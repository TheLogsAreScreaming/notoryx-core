# NOTORYX Core

Part of the **NOTORYX** off-grid communications family. **No Towers. No Limits.**

> NOTORYX Core was previously named Bastion. Its package ID (`com.bastionmesh.bastion`) and Android signing key are unchanged, so existing installs update in place and keep their data.

**Off-grid messaging, check-ins and SOS over your MeshCore LoRa radio.**

NOTORYX Core turns your phone or computer and a [MeshCore](https://meshcore.io/) radio into a field communicator that works without cell service, Wi-Fi or the internet. Messages hop from radio to radio across the mesh.

</p>

> NOTORYX Core 10.0 is released, with 10.1 in pre-release. It is checked by automated tests and a mesh simulator but not yet on a wide range of phones and radios: see [Known limitations](docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md). It is not a replacement for an emergency service or a satellite messenger. Please [report problems in notoryx-core-releases](https://github.com/TheLogsAreScreaming/notoryx-core-releases/issues/new/choose) (issues are off in this source repository).

### Install on Android

**Easiest: get updates automatically with [Obtainium](https://obtainium.imranr.dev/).** On your phone, install Obtainium, then tap the badge below. It adds NOTORYX Core with pre-releases included and the Android APK picked out, and tells you when a new build is out.

<p><a href="https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev/redirect?r=obtainium://app/%7B%22id%22%3A%22com.bastionmesh.bastion%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FTheLogsAreScreaming%2Fnotoryx-core-releases%22%2C%22author%22%3A%22TheLogsAreScreaming%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22NOTORYX%20Core%22%2C%22additionalSettings%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22includePrereleases%5C%22%3Atrue%2C%5C%22apkFilterRegEx%5C%22%3A%5C%22arm64-v8a%5C%5C%5C%5C.apk%24%5C%22%2C%5C%22autoApkFilterByArch%5C%22%3Atrue%2C%5C%22versionDetection%5C%22%3Atrue%7D%22%7D"><img src="branding/badge_obtainium.png" width="161" alt="Get it on Obtainium"></a></p>

Or install the APK yourself:

1. On your phone, open the release and download the `.apk`.
2. Open the file. If Android asks, allow installs from your browser or file manager.
3. Open NOTORYX Core and allow **Bluetooth**, **location** and **notifications** when asked.

**Upgrading from a test build:** builds before 10.0.0-rc.10 were signed with a temporary test key, and Android won't install a release-signed build over them. First make an encrypted backup (**More → Encrypted backup**), then uninstall the old app, install the new one and restore. You only do this once. Later versions install as normal updates.

### Install on a Mac

1. Download the `.zip` from the release and double-click it to unzip.
2. Drag **NOTORYX Core** into your **Applications** folder.
3. Open it. The first time, macOS says it can't check the app for malicious software, because it isn't notarized by Apple.
   - Click **Done**, then open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.
   - Scroll down and click **Open Anyway** next to "NOTORYX Core was blocked", then confirm.
   - You do this once for each new version.
4. Allow Bluetooth when asked.

Each release includes `SHA256SUMS-Android.txt` and `SHA256SUMS-macOS.txt` if you want to check your download (`shasum -a 256 <file>`). How each published file is tied to its source commit, its test run and the signing certificate is described in [Release provenance](docs/RELEASE_PROVENANCE.md).

## Getting started

1. **Connect your radio.** On the home screen, tap **Get started**, or go to **Connect radio**. NOTORYX Core connects over Bluetooth, USB or TCP to a radio running MeshCore companion firmware. Turn on **Connect to my radio automatically** and it reconnects to your last radio when the app opens.
2. **Say hello.** Open **Chats** and send a message on a channel, or open someone in **Nodes** to message them directly.
3. **Choose who gets your check-ins and SOS.** Tap **Check in: I'm OK** or hold **SOS**. The first time, NOTORYX Core asks who should get them. You can change this anytime in **Plan your trip**.
4. **Set your radio for your area.** **Settings → Radio settings → Presets** lists MeshCore's community presets (USA, Canada, EU/UK, Australia and more) with the one for your country suggested first.
5. **Pick a look.** **Settings → Theme** offers eight themes: Blaze (default), Neon Anarchy, Tactical, Pink Overload, Bare Beauty, Okabe-Ito (color-blind safe), Night Ops (low light) and Seasonal.

The tabs at the bottom are **Home**, **Chats**, **Nodes**, **Map** and **More**. Home is where check-in, SOS and your radio's readings live; **More** holds every tool and setting, with a search box.

## Features

### Safety and trips
- **SOS:** hold for 2 seconds to send your radio's position to your trip contacts (and an optional channel). It repeats every 5 minutes until someone replies or you stop it, and **I'm safe** sends an all-clear.
- **Signed SOS:** an SOS on a channel carries a signature from your radio's own key, so other NOTORYX users can see it really came from you. You can sign every channel post too. A post whose signature doesn't check out is shown as unverified, and other apps just see the normal message.
- **SOS relay** (optional, off by default): when your radio hears an SOS straight from the sender and no repeater passes it on, NOTORYX sends it once more so it can reach a repeater the sender can't. Needs radio firmware v1.16 or newer, and is not yet field-tested on radios.
- **Check-ins:** I'm OK, At camp, Delayed and Heading back. You see who each one reached, and can resend to anyone it missed. Check-ins can also go to a team or SAR channel, signed with your radio's key.
- **Check-in reminders and overdue alerts:** a notification when you're due to check in, and a warning when a trip contact goes quiet for longer than you set.
- **Trip planning:** pick up to six contacts. Trip briefs, a Field Log of everything sent and received, and optional automations.
- **Android home-screen widget:** radio status, battery and unread count, with one-tap Check in and SOS.

### Messaging
- Direct and channel messages with delivery status, reactions, GIFs and image messages. Tapping a notification opens that chat.
- **Find channels:** a directory of public hashtag channels (local ones first), channels heard on air that you haven't joined, and **Active online**: the #channels an online analyzer has seen in use, with one-tap Join.
- **Message search**, per-chat **drafts**, **read aloud** and on-device translation.
- **Quick messages:** ready-made replies like "On my way" or "At camp" from the message box menu. Edit the list to make it yours.
- **Direct messages:** stop retrying a message that's still being sent, and a note in a new chat that the other person has to add you as a contact before they can read and answer.
- **Share your position or a contact** from the message box. Received contacts can be added in one tap, and **Add contact from clipboard** accepts links, adverts (even wrapped across lines) and bare public keys.
- **Discovered contacts:** add one with a tap, or long-press to pick several (or **Add all shown**) and add them together, up to the room left on your radio.
- **Region tags:** a channel post scoped to a region shows it next to the time, for example **📍 ct**.
- **Link previews** (off by default, since fetching one tells the site your IP address).
- **Area-limited channel messages** that stay within a radius of you. These need radios running flood-corridor firmware.
- Optional auto-delete of old channel messages.

### Maps, paths and coverage
- Live mesh map with offline map packs, a button to jump to your position (phone GPS, or your radio's), and a **track log** that records your trail and exports GPX.
- **Map telemetry:** battery, temperature, humidity or pressure badges on the map. Readings dim after an hour and hide after a day, and the map remembers your choice.
- **Wardrive:** ping as you drive or hike and map which repeaters heard you, and how well, both ways. Pings use your phone's GPS and the map follows you. Drives are saved.
- **Network scan** (More → Networks): find MeshCore networks nearby. A radio only hears networks on its exact settings, so a scan switches yours to each network in turn and switches back. **Quick** (the default) sends one zero-hop discover ping on each and listens about 8 s, so a scan takes well under a minute; **Thorough** only listens, 30–90 s each, and also finds networks without a repeater in range. The first scan checks every preset in your band; after that, the networks you've found and saved plus your country's preset. Each network heard is logged with the time, place, signal and its nodes, so you can map it, export CSV or GPX, save it, or join it with one tap. You're off your own mesh while it scans, so it won't run during an SOS or a trip, and the radio's auto-add is paused so other networks' nodes don't fill your contacts.
- **Path graph:** every path you've heard, drawn as flows from far repeaters to you. Short (1-byte) hops are matched to a specific repeater using longer paths.
- **Route Intelligence:** learned routes and the best repeaters your radio hears directly.
- **Observer reach:** check which online observers heard a message you sent, how many hops it took and the best signal. Repeaters you don't have as contacts can be named online. Both use a CoreScope analyzer you choose in Settings.
- **Coverage hexagons:** record where your radio got through and upload to your own HTTPS endpoints, with a privacy delay.
- **Antenna coverage** over the terrain, line-of-sight checks and coverage capture sessions.

### Your radio
- **Sensors on Home:** your radio's own readings (battery voltage, temperatures, GPS, light and whatever else it reports).
- **Radio presets:** MeshCore's community catalogue with search and a suggestion for your country. Choosing one keeps your transmit power. Local mesh settings (for example Phoenix's or Philadelphia's) are offered when your radio, or your phone if the radio has no position, is in that area; see [adding your area](#add-your-areas-mesh-settings).
- **Send your advert** zero-hop (only radios that hear you directly) or flooded across the mesh.
- Connections dashboard, live radio stats and a noise-floor chart, adjustable refresh rate and battery saver.
- Command line and Wi-Fi setup for your own radio. With permission, you can also use a trusted contact's command line.

### Field tools
- **Repeater ping:** a one-hop trace showing the signal both ways. **Antenna hunt:** clicks faster as a chosen repeater gets louder.
- Repeater and room-server tools: login, status, neighbors, telemetry, command line and **access control**.
- **Forget last advert** on a contact, for a node whose adverts stopped updating after its clock was reset.
- **Repeater IDs** (who uses an ID, which are free) and **Region setup** (US and Canada region trees, or your own) for repeater owners.
- **Bot Mode:** local auto-replies, keyword rules and commands like `!ping`, `!sun`, `!moon`, `!weather`, `!dice` and `!trace`, in direct messages and in the channels you choose. It can also post weather alerts to a channel.
- **Field guide**, encrypted backup and app-icon shortcuts.

### MQTT bridge (optional)
- **Several brokers at once** over TLS or secure WebSocket, with a Wi-Fi-only option and an offline queue that sends when you're back online. Broker passwords are kept in the system keychain.
- **Live packet feed.** Channel messages that reached you only over the internet are marked **via MQTT**, and never count as radio repeats.
- **Observer sharing** in the community `meshcoretomqtt` format. It's off until you turn it on, and direct messages and your own traffic each need a separate opt-in.
- **LetsMesh-style sign-in** with a token signed by your radio, so its private key never leaves it. LetsMesh (US and EU) and MeshRank presets are included; they're community services, not part of NOTORYX.

### Look and feel
- **Frosted ember:** the main screens sit on a warm glow, with see-through glass panels and a floating tab bar. With reduce motion turned on, the blur is off.
- Eight themes: **Blaze** (charcoal and slate with high-visibility orange, the default), **Neon Anarchy** (toxic green and electric purple on black), **Tactical** (olive, gunmetal and earth tones), **Pink Overload** (hot pink, bubblegum and lavender), **Bare Beauty** (warm nude, dusty rose, cocoa and sage), **Okabe-Ito** (color-blind safe, on charcoal), **Night Ops** (dim reds on near-black for low light) and **Seasonal**, which follows the season by your device's date (spring, summer, autumn, winter, plus optional Halloween, Christmas and Valentine's Day colors) or a season you pick. Every theme meets WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1) for text, buttons, chat bubbles and SOS, and SOS stays red in all of them.
- **Color-blind safe colors:** node types on the map and in lists (people, repeaters, rooms and sensors) use the [Okabe-Ito palette](https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/), whose colors stay distinct with the common forms of color blindness. The **Okabe-Ito** theme goes further: good, warning and bad signal are blue-green, yellow and vermillion instead of green and red, and every accent comes from the same palette.

  | Orange | Sky blue | Bluish green | Yellow | Blue | Vermillion | Reddish purple | Black |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | `#E69F00` | `#56B4E9` | `#009E73` | `#F0E442` | `#0072B2` | `#D55E00` | `#CC79A7` | `#000000` |

## Add your area's mesh settings

When a local mesh agrees on new radio settings, NOTORYX Core can offer them to everyone nearby. The live list is [`regional_presets.json` in notoryx-core-releases](https://github.com/TheLogsAreScreaming/notoryx-core-releases/blob/main/regional_presets.json), which NOTORYX Core checks every 12 hours. The app also bundles a copy, [`assets/regional_presets.json`](assets/regional_presets.json), for first launch and offline use; update it to match the live list before each release.

To add or update an area, [open an issue in notoryx-core-releases](https://github.com/TheLogsAreScreaming/notoryx-core-releases/issues/new). Each entry has:

```json
{
  "id": "us-philadelphia",
  "name": "Philadelphia",
  "center": [39.9526, -75.1652],
  "radiusKm": 100,
  "frequencyMHz": 919.5,
  "bandwidthKHz": 500,
  "spreadingFactor": 10,
  "codingRate": 5,
  "pathHashBytes": 2,
  "updated": "2026-10-17",
  "notes": "Where this comes from and anything people should know."
}
```

Please say in `notes` where the settings come from. Change `updated` whenever the settings change: that's what triggers the "settings changed" notification.

Most entries are worked out from the public [MeshCore map](https://map.meshcore.io), where node owners report their settings. These have `"source": "map"` and a node count, and the app labels them as reported, not checked on air. They leave out `pathHashBytes` because the map doesn't report it, so applying one doesn't change the radio's path hash size. They're made with [`tools/regional_presets`](tools/regional_presets/README.md), which only lists areas that differ from the usual settings for their part of the world. Hand-made entries (no `source`) are kept when the list is regenerated and win over a map area with the same settings. The file is `"version": 2`; older app versions ignore it and keep the list they have.
